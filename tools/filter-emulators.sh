#
# Output a command for filtering unnecessary warnings (as we think) from the Firebase Emulators console output.
#
# THIS MUST ONLY BE CALLED WHEN THERE'S NO ACTIVE PROJECT.
#
# Reasoning:
#
#   Without an active project (and no other means of authentication, such as tokens), the emulators won't be able
#   to reach the cloud instance, and there's no need for the warnings. Rrright???
#
# Ideally...: ðŸ¤ž
#
#   - Firebase would have a more "offline first" approach to testing, meaning the _safest_ configuration is also the
#     _easiest_ to set up.
#   - Firebase Emulators would _not call Wolf!_ if there's not one around. (imagine wolf emoji!)
#
# Note on 'grep':
#   - Need to give the keys to 'grep -v' as a _single_ parameter ('grep -v ... | grep -v ...' suffocates all output, for some reason..).
#   - Multiple approaches with quotes and '\ ' failed (in connection to launching from 'package.json'); replacing with '.' works. :P
#

# If running CI, suppress other set of messages than in dev (no warning about suppression)
