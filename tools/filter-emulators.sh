#
# Output a command for filtering unnecessary output (as we think) from the Firebase Emulators console output.
#
# Context:
#   development, not Alpine Linux (CI)
#
# Ideally...: ðŸ¤ž
#   - Firebase would change the definition of an "offline" project to include anything not a active project
#   - Firebase Emulators would not have unnecessary logging (such as the "Detected demo project"). We are testing
#     real stuff - calling it demo is.. misleading and confusing. They are tests.
#
# Note on 'grep':
#   - Need to give the keys to 'grep -v' as a _single_ parameter ('grep -v ... | grep -v ...' suffocates all output, for some reason..).
#   - Multiple approaches with quotes and '\ ' failed (in connection to launching from 'package.json'); replacing with '.' works. :P
#

# Filtering if started with '--project demo-...'
# <<
#   i  emulators: Detected demo project ID "demo-1", emulated services will use a demo configuration and attempts to access non-emulated services for this project will fail.
# <<
#
if [[ true ]]; then
  KEY1="Detected demo project"
  echo "grep -v ${KEY1// /.}"
fi

# --- rest was used for filtering out warnings, but not necessary now
#
## If running CI, suppress other set of messages than in dev (no warning about suppression)
## <<
##   âš   emulators: You are not currently authenticated so some features may not work correctly. Please run firebase login to authenticate the CLI.
##   âš   functions: You are not signed in to the Firebase CLI. If you have authorized this machine using gcloud application-default credentials those may be discovered and used to access production services.
