# ci/cloudbuild.yaml
#
# Intention:
#   Check that the project installs and runs the tests.
#
# Triggers:
#   - PR is made or changed; changes affect files other than '*.md', '.images/*', 'images/*'. [1]
#
#     [1]: Also some subfolders are ignored by the CI trigger, say 'sh', ... (the list may change; they should be
#          included also in '../.gcloudignore').
#
# Cloud Build project (private access):
#   https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers?project=ci-builder
#
# Uses images:
#   - node:16-alpine
#   - firebase-ci-builder   (pushed to Container Registry)
#   - docker/compose
#
# Runtime environment:
#   - Current directory is '/workspace'
#   - env.variables (just some):
#     PWD=/workspace
#     HOME=/builder/home
#
# Note:
#   Using 'node:16' to run 'npm install' means that the packages are installed as root, and 'node_modules' is read-only
#   to regular users (of other images). This is normally not a concern.

    #           Our tests should pass also with it.
