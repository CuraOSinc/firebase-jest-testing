Tools for testing Firebase back-end features, using Jest.

This repo provides a "one stop", opinionated approach to testing Firebase projects. Using it may save you from reading countless pages of documentation and evaluating different testing strategies and libraries.

Also, the tools handle configuring emulation for you. In all, this tries to give a simpler development experience than the current (Aug 2021) Firebase tooling does.

The idea is that you don't have to pull in either `firebase-admin` nor `firebase` in your own testing project, but get all the tools through here.


## Folder structure

The package itself is placed under `package`.

The `sample` folder contains a sample Firebase backend used for testing:

- `sample/functions` has the definitions of the Cloud Functions
- `sample/firestore.rules` has the Firestore Security Rules
- `sample/test-fns` contains Cloud Function tests
- `sample/test-rules` contains Security Rules tests

The files used for managing the Firebase project and running tests are at the root.

## Requirements

- node >= 17.5
- npm >= 7.7.0
- Jest >= 28

   Jest 28 is currently in alpha. This library **hops to only support it** (not Jest 27), starting 0.0.4-alpha.6. If you need the tool for Jest 27, use earlier releases.

<!--
>Note: `npm` 6 support is there, because it's the default for Node 14 Docker images. Kept somewhat grudgingly, for now. CI runs `npm` 6; all development is done with `npm` 7.
-->

<!--
Developed with:
- macOS 12.2
- node 17.5
- npm 8.4
-->

## Getting started

Fetch dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

>The `package.json` is prepared so that this installs dependencies also for `package` and `sample/functions`. 

Now, you're ready to start the emulation and run tests against it.


## Two ways ahead

There are two ways to run the tests, each with their own pros and cons. We'll call them the "CI" (Continuous Integration) and "dev" (development) flows, according to their main use cases.

Let's start with the simpler one.


### CI: Run all the tests

<!-- hidden; took away `ci:par`
The `npm` targets in this flow:

|target|what it does|
|---|---|
|`ci`|Maps to either `ci:seq` or `ci:par`|
|`ci:seq`|Run tests sequentially|
|`ci:par`|Run tests in parallel|

The sequential runs provide easier-to-follow logs, but `ci:par` provides ~2s faster execution[^1-faster], since the Cloud Functions and Security Rules are tested in parallel. 

>Depending on your tests, the difference may be starker, so `ci:par` is kept in the repo as a sample.

[^1-faster]: Faster on a desktop (multicore) machine, which you might not have in CI/CD.
-->

Launching the tests is this easy:

```
$ npm test
...
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.547 s, estimated 3 s

...
Test Suites: 5 passed, 5 total
Tests:       29 passed, 29 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        5.389 s
```

There are two separate Jest test suites run here, one after the other. One for Cloud Functions and another for Security Rules tests. It is possible to merge these but the author currently thinks it's best to keep them separate.

In "CI mode", each run launches the emulators anew. This takes ~5s that we can spare, by using the "dev" mode.


### Dev mode

In dev mode, a server runs continuously on the background so repeated runs of the tests are a bit faster. This same server can be used for both Cloud Functions and Security Rules testing - even in parallel.

**Starting the emulator**

Start the emulator in one terminal, and leave it running:

```
$ npm run start
```

Once we run tests, it's worth checking the emulator output, occasionally.

**Running tests**

In another terminal:

```
$ npm run test:fns:greet
$ npm run test:fns:userInfo
...
```

For testing Security Rules:

```
$ npm run test:rules:invites
$ npm run test:rules:projects
$ npm run test:rules:symbols
$ npm run test:rules:userInfo
$ npm run test:rules:visited
```

Sure you get the gist of it. ðŸ¤“

These are prepared for you in `package.json`. When developing something, it's meaningful to run only one suite, at a time.

Once you think things are rolling fine, run `npm test` to confirm.

>Note: Since both CI and dev use the same emulator ports (defined in `firebase.json`), one cannot launch `npm test` while the emulator is running. Shut it down by Ctrl-C.


## CI setup

Continuous Integration uses Docker Compose, to run the same tests.

See [`ci/README`](ci/README.md) for details.
