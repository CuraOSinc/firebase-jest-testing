Tools for testing Firebase back-end features, using Jest.

This repo provides a "one stop", opinionated approach to testing Firebase projects. Using it may save you from reading countless pages of documentation and evaluating different testing strategies and libraries.

Also, the tools handle configuring emulation for you. In all, this tries to give a simpler development experience than the current (May 2021) Firebase tooling does.

Only admin-side JS SDKs are used. For client interaction, this uses REST API.

The idea is that you don't have to pull in either `firebase-admin` nor `firebase` in your own project, but get all the tools through here.


## Folder structure

The package itself is placed under `package`.

The `sample` folder contains a sample Firebase backend used for testing:

- `sample/functions` has the definitions of the Cloud Functions
- `sample/firestore.rules` has the Firestore Security Rules
- `sample/test-fns` contains Cloud Function tests
- `sample/test-rules` contains Security Rules tests

The files used for managing the Firebase project and running tests are at the root.

## Requirements

- node >= 14.3 or 16.x
- npm 6 or >= 7.7.0
- Jest >= 27

>Note: The author would like to drop `npm` 6 support, but it's the default for Node 14 images. Kept somewhat grudgingly, for now. (CI runs `npm` 6; all development is run with `npm` 7)

<!--
Developed with:
- macOS 11.5
- node 16.2
- npm 7.19
-->

## Getting started

Fetch dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

>The `package.json` is prepared so that this installs dependencies also for `package` and `sample/functions`. 

Now, you're ready to start the emulation and run tests against it.


## Two ways ahead

There are two ways to run the tests, each with their own pros and cons. We'll call them the "CI" (Continuous Integration) and "dev" (development) flows, according to their main use cases.

Let's start with the simpler one.


### CI: Run all the tests

The `npm` targets in this flow:

|target|what it does|
|---|---|
|`ci`|Maps to either `ci:seq` or `ci:par`|
|`ci:seq`|Run tests sequentially|
|`ci:par`|Run tests in parallel|

The sequential runs provide easier-to-follow logs, but `ci:par` provides ~2s faster execution[^1-faster], since the Cloud Functions and Security Rules are tested in parallel. 

>Depending on your tests, the difference may be starker, so `ci:par` is kept in the repo as a sample.

[^1-faster]: Faster on a desktop (multicore) machine, which you might not have in CI/CD.


Launching the tests is this easy:

```
$ npm run ci
...
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.547 s, estimated 3 s

...
Test Suites: 5 passed, 5 total
Tests:       29 passed, 29 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        5.389 s
```

Note that the results for Cloud Functions tests and Security Rules tests are provided separately. It could be possible to merge these but the author currently thinks it's not carrying real benefits.

The downside of "CI mode" is that each run launches a new emulator. This takes ~5s that we can spare, by using the "dev" mode.


### Dev mode

In dev mode, a server runs continuously on the background so repeated runs of the tests are a bit faster.

**Starting the emulator**

Start the emulator in one terminal, and leave it running:

```
$ npm run start
```

Once we run tests, it's worth checking the emulator output, occasionally.

**Running tests**

In another terminal:

```
$ npm run test:fns:callables
$ npm run test:fns:userInfo
...
```

For testing Security Rules:

```
$ npm run test:rules:invites
$ npm run test:rules:projects
$ npm run test:rules:symbols
$ npm run test:rules:userInfo
$ npm run test:rules:visited
```

Sure you get the gist of it. ðŸ¤“

These are prepared for you in `package.json`. When developing something, it's meaningful to run only one suite, at a time.

Once you think things are rolling fine, run `npm run ci` to confirm.

>Note: Since both CI and dev use the same emulator ports (defined in `firebase.json`), one cannot launch `npm run ci` while the emulator is running. Shut it down by Ctrl-C.


## CI setup

CI is set up for pull requests, using Cloud Build.

See [`ci/README`](ci/README.md) for details.
