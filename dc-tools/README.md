# Running with Docker

The main `README` describes how to run the Firebase Emulators, and e.g. `npm test` natively. If you are using Docker Compose, you may prefer to use it, instead.

This also serves as a template for your custom application repo.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop for Mac

## Launch the emulator

```
$ npm run docker:up
```

The emulator remains running in the background. When using Docker Compose, you don't need to deal with multiple terminal windows.

>Hint: To see the Emulator console output, go to Docker > Dashboard > ...tbd.


## Run the tests

### 1. One by one

```

```

### 2. All at once

```
```
